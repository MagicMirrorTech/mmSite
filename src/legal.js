Box 50191, Minneapolis, MN 55405), which Code of Procedure, as in effect or replaced from time to time, is incorporated into and forms an integral part of these terms. However, before you submit a Claim for arbitration, you must first contact our customer service representatives at help@magicmirror.dev, and give us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. Similarly, before MM takes a dispute to arbitration, we must first attempt to resolve it by contacting you. If the dispute cannot be satisfactorily resolved within sixty (60) days from the date you or MM is notified by the other of a dispute, then either party may then initiate the arbitration process as provided in the National Arbitration Forum’s Code of Procedure. For greater certainty, no recourse may be made by either party to any court or tribunal, whether federal or provincial, in respect of any matter whatsoever relating to these terms including, without limitation, any Claim, any arbitration initiated to resolve a Claim, and any arbitration award made in relation to a Claim, except as expressly permitted in these terms or by law. Any award rendered pursuant to the arbitration shall be final and binding on each of the parties and no appeal shall lie from such award. Such award may be rendered enforceable and executory by any court having jurisdiction over the person or the property of the person against whom enforcement of the award is sought. No claim may be joined with another lawsuit, or in an arbitration with a dispute of any other person, or resolved on a class-wide basis. The parties expressly agree that any claim that is arbitrated pursuant to these terms shall not be consolidated with any other arbitral proceeding for any reason. The arbitrator may not award damages that are barred by these terms and may not award exemplary or punitive damages or attorneys’ fees. You and MM both waive any claims for an award of damages that are excluded under these terms.'

Some organizations comply with these requirements by placing a banner on their website to inform users that tracking cookies used for OBA will be placed on their browsers. Other organizations become members of the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (“DAAC”), which administers the “Your Ad Choice” program, and place the AdChoice logo on their website as a link to a dedicated page (i.e. outside of the privacy policy) explaining how visitors’ information is collected for ad purposes.
